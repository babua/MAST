MAST Alpha 0.04

-Fixed a minor bug in timeDomainData plotting (error when tdd.sourceFilename was empty)
-For unavoidable failures of "determinant too small" in mgcep (i.e. adjusting -e and -f doesn't work), 
added a feature where MAST tries MGC extraction at a higher order, then, if successful converts those 
coefficients to the original target order.
-Added properties to sptk class for using the "-e" and "-f" options in mgcep (through sptk.extractMgc), 
sptk.mgcPeriodogramOffset and sptk.mgcMinimumDeterminant, respectively.



MAST Alpha 0.03
-Renamed pitch extraction functions to be correctly named according to algorithm
	|=> renamed sptk.extractPitchHTS() to sptk.extractPitchGetF0()
	|=> added sptk.extractPitchRAPT()
	*These functions both use the RAPT algorithm, but different implementations.
	sptk.extractPitchGetF0 requires the getf0.tcl script, which can be found e.g. in the HTS training scripts
-Added the option to use a specified voiced/unvoiced threshold in sptk.extractPitchSWIPE()
The value is stored in sptk.thresholdSWIPE with the default of 0.3
-Added "Speak Aloud" feature, which displays the calls made to the system in the MATLAB command window. Set sptk.speakAloud to 1 to enable.



MAST Alpha 0.02
-Fixed isPrecision not being found in freqDomainData and mgcData (Thanks Alexis!)
-Fixed the error in plot titles due to improper referencing of the cell array. Titles now display the last element of the sourceFilename array recursively. (Thanks Alexis!)
-Turned off the LaTeX interpreter in plot titles to fix display of filenames with underscores.



MAST Alpha 0.01
-First release!
